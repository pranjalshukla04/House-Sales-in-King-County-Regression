</p>

This project takes you through the following stages:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights and identify patterns.
- Feature selection to determine the most relevant features.
- Model training and evaluation using Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Polynomial Regression (degree 2 and 3).
- Hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
- Comparing and analyzing model results.
- Drawing conclusions based on model performances and insights gained.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises house sale records between May 2014 and May 2015. It includes various features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, condition, grade, and more.
